## Executive Summary

This repository demonstrates a comprehensive analytics workflow for marketing performance analysis, covering user funnel optimization, retention cohorts, trend analysis, and predictive modeling. The project showcases modern data analysis techniques including SQL-driven reporting, dashboard development, data integrity monitoring, and ROI forecasting to extract valuable insights from marketing data and drive strategic decision-making.

### What this project demonstrates?

* Actionable analytics: Clear funnel and ROI/ROAS insights that translate into concrete recommendations for marketing and product teams.
* Cohort retention: D1/D7 cohort analysis by acquisition channel and platform, highlighting where to invest or iterate on creatives/targeting.
* Forecasting/modeling: A small but production-minded forecasting or churn prototype to illustrate predictive capability.
* Reporting craft: Reproducible SQL, cleaned notebooks, and exportable figures suitable for dashboards and executive communication.

### Data & Scope

* Dataset: Cookie Cats (Kaggle) user-level/mobile game telemetry, enriched with synthetic user acquisition attributes (e.g., acquisition_channel, CAC/ad spend, revenue fields) to enable ROI/ROAS analysis.
* KPIs: D1/D7 retention, conversion funnel step rates, ROI/ROAS by channel, ARPDAU/Revenue trends (optional), and a focused prediction target (e.g., D7 or revenue proxy).
* Decisions supported: Budget reallocation across channels, creative/testing priorities, onboarding/FTUE optimizations, and retention-oriented product bets.
